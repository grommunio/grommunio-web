##### 07 january 2024
- __API__
  - Upgraded Phpfastcache API to `4.3.0` ([see changes](CHANGELOG_API.md))
- __Extensions__ (ðŸ’¡ New in 9.2)
  - Created an extension mechanism to allow some drivers to be loaded independently, see [README.md](README.md)
  - Added support of `Couchbasev4` as an extension with its own [sub-repository](https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/couchbasev4-extension).
  - **IMPORTANT**: *AS OF v9.2* the following drivers has been **MOVED** to their own sub-repositories as a standalone extension: `Arangodb`, `Couchdb`, `Dynamodb`, `Firestore`, `Mongodb`, `Solr`. However `Couchbasev3` will stay in the core for compatibility reasons but will be deprecated. 
  - **IMPORTANT**: *AS OF v10* extensions will have their namespaces permanently moved from `Phpfastcache\Drivers\EXT_NAME\{Config, Driver, Event, Item}` to `Phpfastcache\Extensions\Drivers\EXT_NAME\{Config, Driver, Event, Item}`. For now an alias is ensuring compatibility.

- __Pool__
  - Added `ExtendedCacheItemPoolTrait::getAllItems` to allow you to retrieve all items in the cache. This method have some limitations, ([see more in the Wiki](https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/wiki/%5BV5%CB%96%5D-Fetching-all-keys)).
- __Core__
  - Configuration methods`ConfigurationOption::isPreventCacheSlams()`, `ConfigurationOption::setPreventCacheSlams()`, `ConfigurationOption::getCacheSlamsTimeout()`, `ConfigurationOption::setCacheSlamsTimeout()` are deprecated. ([See changes](CHANGELOG_API.md)).
  - Fixed #907 // Internal "driver decode()" method will now throw an if the string data looks corrupted.
  - Internal: Implemented multiple keys fetch (*if supported by the backend*) to improve the performances behind all `getItems()` calls. Currently only supported in some backends, but it may evolve in the future.
  - Internal: Implemented multiple keys delete (*if supported by the backend*) to improve the performances behind all `deleteItems()` calls. Currently only supported in some backends, but it may evolve in the future.
